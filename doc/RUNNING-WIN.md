#RUNNING ON WINDOWS#

to run on windows, you need to do the following things in order(only for the first time running):
1. run EagleCoinservice.exe in the main directory of the coin.
2. press install
3. run eaglecoin.exe
4. done!
5. to access the wallet, open a browser(preferably google chrome) and go to localhost:7876/index.html
if you have already installed using eaglecoinservice, you can just run eaglecoin.exe.
